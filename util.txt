✅ Level: Easy to Medium
Sum of Array Except Self

Given an array nums, return an array where answer[i] is the sum of all elements in nums except nums[i].

Product of Array Except Self with Zeroes

Modify the original problem to handle multiple zeroes in the array properly.

Prefix Product Array

Given an array nums, return an array where output[i] = product(nums[0] * nums[1] * ... * nums[i]).

Suffix Product Array

Same as above but in reverse. output[i] = product(nums[i] * nums[i+1] * ... * nums[n-1]).

✅ Level: Medium
Product of Array Except Self (No Division, O(1) Extra Space)

Solve the original problem without using division and using only constant extra space (output array not counted).

Find Element with Product of Others

Given an array, check if any element equals the product of all the other elements.

Array of Products of All Pairs (excluding self)

For each element i, return product of all pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) for j ≠ i.

Maximum Product of Three Numbers

Given an integer array, find the maximum product of any three numbers.

✅ Level: Hard
Product of Array Except Self for 2D Matrix

Given a 2D matrix, return a matrix where each cell contains the product of all elements in the matrix except that cell (bonus: no division).

K-Product Exclusion

Generalize the problem to return product of all elements except the current one and k neighbors (e.g., k=1 means exclude i-1, i, i+1).
